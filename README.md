# Data-Exploration_Analyzing-Housing-and-Visit-Patterns

## Project Overview
This project explores various urban metrics, including average rent, population size, household data, and both physical and virtual visit trends across multiple cities.

The dataset includes the following columns:
1. City: The name of the city/MSA
2. Average Rent: Average rental prices in the MSA
3. Total Population: Total population within the MSA
4. Total Household: Total number of households
5. Physical Visits: Count of physical visits
